# Multi-Agent Traffic Control System

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced **Multi-Agent Traffic Control System** that coordinates Regional Agents, Traffic Agent, and Prediction Engine for optimal traffic management using Large Language Models (LLMs). 

**Key Innovation**: Transform traditional single-vehicle route planning into a coordinated multi-agent architecture where intelligent agents collaborate to minimize travel time and optimize traffic flow across urban networks.
