# Multi-Agent Traffic Control System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-agent traffic control system that transforms the existing single-vehicle navigation architecture into a collaborative regional coordination system. The system integrates Regional Agents, Traffic Agents, and Prediction Engines for optimized traffic management.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Regional Agent** (`agents/regional_agent.py`)
   - Manages intra-regional route planning for vehicles within specific regions
   - Plans fastest routes to boundary edges to exit regions  
   - Assigns lanes to avoid congestion and coordinate green wave traffic flow
   - Uses LLM for intelligent decision making based on traffic context
   - Tracks planned routes to prevent route overcrowding

2. **Traffic Agent** (`agents/traffic_agent.py`)
   - Handles macro route planning between regions  
   - Monitors global traffic state and boundary edge utilization
   - Provides recommendations to Regional Agents based on system-wide conditions
   - Uses LLM for macro route optimization across regional boundaries
   - Coordinates inter-regional vehicle flow

3. **Prediction Engine** (`agents/prediction_engine.py`)
   - Implements autoregressive traffic flow prediction
   - Supports multiple time windows (180s, 360s, 540s, 720s)
   - Provides traffic forecasting for route planning decisions
   - Uses historical data to predict congestion patterns

4. **Agent Logger** (`agents/agent_logger.py`)
   - Comprehensive logging and monitoring system
   - Real-time vehicle tracking and performance metrics
   - LLM call monitoring and success rate tracking
   - Console progress display with system throughput metrics
   - Detailed decision and error logging

5. **Multi-Agent Environment** (`multi_agent_env.py`)
   - Main orchestrator for the multi-agent system
   - Coordinates all agents and manages simulation lifecycle
   - Handles asynchronous decision-making across regions
   - Integrates with existing SUMO/TraCI infrastructure

- **LLM-powered route planning** for both regional and macro routing
- **Batch processing** of multiple vehicle decisions for efficiency
- **Fallback heuristics** when LLM calls fail
- **Context-aware observations** including traffic state and predictions

### Performance Optimization
- **Green wave coordination** for smooth traffic flow within regions
- **Congestion prediction** using autoregressive models

- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and analysis
- **Modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Integration testing** to ensure system reliability

## Regional Data Structure

The system utilizes regional partition data located in `Data/Region_1/`:

- **boundary_edges_alpha_1.json**: 465 boundary connections between regions
- **edge_to_region_alpha_1.json**: Mapping of road edges to region IDs
- **partition_results_alpha_1.json**: Complete region partition information

### Region Statistics
- Total regions: 20
- Regional agents: 20 (one per region)  
- Boundary edges: 465
- Edge-to-region mappings: Complete road network coverage

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Multi-Agent System

1. **Use the existing main script with multi-agent flag**:
```bash
python main.py --multi-agent --llm-path-or-name "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
```

2. **Use the dedicated runner script**:
```bash
python run_multi_agent.py quick    # Quick test
python run_multi_agent.py full     # Full simulation  
python run_multi_agent.py compare  # Compare single vs multi-agent
```

3. **Custom configuration**:
```bash
python run_multi_agent.py custom --llm "your-model" --step-size 180 --max-steps 43200
```

### Testing the System

Run the integration test to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_integration.py
```

This will test:
- Module imports
- Data file availability  
- Agent initialization
- Multi-agent environment setup
