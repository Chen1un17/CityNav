Do NOT compute or introduce any scores, weights, or thresholds.\n\n## Vehicle Requests (raw)\n\n<route_requests>\n\n## Regional Metrics (raw subset)\n\n<regional_conditions>\n\n## Candidate Region Sequences (raw)\n\n<region_routes>\n\n## Boundary Edge Status (raw)\n\n<boundary_analysis>\n\n## Short-term Traffic Info (if provided, raw)\n\n<flow_predictions>\n\n## Global Snapshot (raw)\n\n<global_state>\n\n## Qualitative Guidance\n\n- Favor routes that are shorter and more direct when raw facts are similar.\n- Avoid regions or boundary edges that currently look congested or stopped in the raw data.\n- When multiple vehicles head to the same region/boundary, prefer options that naturally disperse flows (based on raw planned movements if present).\n- Choose only from the provided options.\n\n## Response Format\n\nReturn JSON with only the selected option number per vehicle. No extra text in the primary fields.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"macro_routes\": [\n    {\n      \"vehicle_id\": \"VEHICLE_ID\",\n      \"origin_region\": \"START_REGION_ID\",\n      \"destination_region\": \"END_REGION_ID\",\n      \"selected_route_option\": 2,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Chose 2: shorter and uses boundaries without recent slow/stop notes\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
