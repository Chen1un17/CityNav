  "template": "## Multi-Agent Traffic Control Decision\n\nYou are coordinating traffic decisions for multiple vehicles in a regional or global context. Use ONLY the raw data provided. Do NOT invent scores, weights, thresholds, or derived rankings.\n\n## Task Scope\n\n<task_scope>\n\n## Current System State (raw)\n\n<system_state>\n\n## Coordination Context (raw)\n\n<coordination_context>\n\n## Available Options\n\n<answer_option_form>\n\n## Regional Communication (raw)\n\n<inter_region_communication>\n\n## Objective (qualitative)\n\n- Prefer routes that are shorter and simpler when raw data is similar.\n- Avoid edges/regions showing signs of congestion or stoppage in the raw data.\n- If multiple vehicles converge on the same region/boundary, prefer options that disperse flows.\n- Only choose from the given options.\n\n## Decision Analysis (optional, qualitative)\n\n<data_analysis>\n\n## Historical Experience (optional)\n\n<experience>\n\n## Instructions\n\n**CRITICAL: Select ONLY the option number (1, 2, 3, ...) from the available options. Do NOT include option content or any non-numeric characters.**\n\nWork strictly from the raw facts above. Do not compute or assume hidden thresholds. If multiple options appear close based on raw facts, favor the simpler and more stable option.\n\n**Response Format Requirements:**\n- `answer`: EXACTLY the option number (integer). No quotes needed if native JSON number.\n- `summary`: Brief qualitative reasoning based on raw facts.\n\n**Example Response Format:**\n```JSON\n{\n  \"answer\": 2,\n  \"summary\": \"Chose 2 because it is shorter and avoids edges recently noted as slow\"\n}\n```\n\n**Your Response:**\n```JSON\n{\n  \"answer\": YOUR_SELECTED_OPTION_NUMBER,\n  \"summary\": \"YOUR_RAW-DATA-BASED_REASONING\"\n}\n```"
