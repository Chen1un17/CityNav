  "template": "## Multi-Agent Traffic Control Decision\n\nYou are coordinating traffic decisions for multiple vehicles in a regional or global context. Your goal is to minimize total system travel time through intelligent coordination.\n\n## Task Scope: <task_scope>\n\n## Current System State\n\n<system_state>\n\n## Coordination Context\n\n<coordination_context>\n\n## Available Options\n\n<answer_option_form>\n\n## Regional Communication\n\n<inter_region_communication>\n\n## Global Optimization Objective\n\nMinimize total system travel time by:\n1. Avoiding congested routes and load balancing across available paths\n2. Coordinating vehicle flows between regions to prevent bottlenecks\n3. Considering predicted traffic patterns and system-wide impacts\n4. Prioritizing efficient boundary edge utilization\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\n<data_analysis>\n\n## Historical Experience\n\n<experience>\n\n## Instructions\n\n**CRITICAL: You must select ONLY the option number (1, 2, 3, etc.) from the available options above. Do NOT return option content or descriptions.**\n\nAnalyze the current traffic situation and coordination needs. Consider:\n- Current congestion levels and predicted patterns\n- Inter-regional traffic flows and boundary utilization\n- Vehicle coordination opportunities within and between regions\n- System-wide optimization rather than individual vehicle optimization\n\n**Response Format Requirements:**\n- `answer`: Must be EXACTLY the option number (integer: 1, 2, 3, etc.)\n- `summary`: Your reasoning for selecting this option\n- Both fields are REQUIRED and must not be null/empty\n\n**Example Response Format:**\n```JSON\n{\n  \"answer\": 2,\n  \"summary\": \"Selected option 2 because it provides the best balance of travel time reduction and load distribution across boundary edges, minimizing system-wide congestion while maintaining individual vehicle efficiency.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Your Response:**\n```JSON\n{\n  \"answer\": YOUR_SELECTED_OPTION_NUMBER,\n  \"summary\": \"YOUR_COORDINATION_STRATEGY_AND_REASONING\"\n}\n```"
