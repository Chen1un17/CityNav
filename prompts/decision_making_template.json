  "template": "## Multi-Agent Traffic Control Decision\n\nYou are coordinating traffic decisions for multiple vehicles in a regional or global context. Your goal is to minimize total system travel time through intelligent coordination.\n\n## Task Scope: <task_scope>\n\n## Current System State\n\n<system_state>\n\n## Coordination Context\n\n<coordination_context>\n\n## Available Options\n\n<answer_option_form>\n\n## Regional Communication\n\n<inter_region_communication>\n\n## Global Optimization Objective\n\nMinimize total system travel time by:\n1. Avoiding congested routes and load balancing across available paths\n2. Coordinating vehicle flows between regions to prevent bottlenecks\n3. Considering predicted traffic patterns and system-wide impacts\n4. Prioritizing efficient boundary edge utilization\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\n<data_analysis>\n\n## Historical Experience\n\n<experience>\n\n## Instructions\n\nAnalyze the current traffic situation and coordination needs. Consider:\n- Current congestion levels and predicted patterns\n- Inter-regional traffic flows and boundary utilization\n- Vehicle coordination opportunities within and between regions\n- System-wide optimization rather than individual vehicle optimization\n\nProvide your coordinated decision with detailed reasoning:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"answer\": <answer_option_form>,\n  \"summary\": \"YOUR_COORDINATION_STRATEGY_AND_REASONING\",\n  \"coordination_impact\": \"EXPECTED_SYSTEM_WIDE_BENEFITS\",\n  \"alternative_considered\": \"OTHER_OPTIONS_EVALUATED\"\n}\n```"
